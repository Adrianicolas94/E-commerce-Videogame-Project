Welcome to my e-commerce project built using React! This project was created as part of the Bath University front-end bootcamp, and it showcases a video game seller e-commerce website.

In this project, I utilized React, React Router DOM, and Context to create a responsive and dynamic user interface. Users can add games to their cart, and the cart will persist even if they navigate away from the page.

To improve this project in the future, I plan to add back-end features such as payment processing using Stripe. Additionally, I would like to enhance the mobile screen size responsive design, and integrate an API to fetch real-time data from reliable sources.

Overall, this project showcases my ability to build a responsive and functional e-commerce website using React, and I'm excited to continue improving it in the future.
